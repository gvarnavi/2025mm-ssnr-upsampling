## Center of Mass Imaging CTF

- Center-of-mass imaging CTF is given by the complex-probe autocorrelation function:

:::{math}
:label: icom_ctf_eq
\mathrm{Im}\left\{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{iCOM}}(\bm{q})\right\} = \left[\psi \star \psi \right](\bm{q}).

Effect of various aberrations on the iCoM CTF.
The resulting CTF is shown on the left, radial average in the middle, and effect on weak phase object in the right panel [@10.69761/ehch7395].
